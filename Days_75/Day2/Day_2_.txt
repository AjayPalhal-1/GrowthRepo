// Key Takeaways:
// Abstraction is about showing only the relevant details while hiding the complex internal workings.
// It promotes selective ignorance, focusing on aspects that matter in the given context.
// Through abstraction, systems become more user-friendly, flexible, and secure, aligning with modular
//  and scalable development practices.
