Solved 2nd problem on Map



Frequency Counting with map :

 Learned to count the frequency of each
 character in a string using a map, where the key is the character and the value is its count.



 If i need to work on string then for key i need use datatype as "char" 
 for values "int" for counting the occurance of charecters.
