Solved Problem On Map


The keys are the real data you want to track (unique elements).    Key : DATA 
The values provide useful information about those keys             Values : Metadata

1. Map Lookup Operation:
•Maps use a lookup operation to find whether a key already exists in the map. 
2. Default Value for Keys:
•When a key is entering in the map for the first time  the map inserts the key with a 
default value 0 for int type keys . 
3. Updating Values:
•The ++ operator is responsible for incrementing the values of the key. 
•For example: 
•If the value for key = 2 is 0,  // 2 entering firstly  
freq_map[2]++ updates it to 1.   // key = 2 , value = 1
•If the value for key = 2 is 1, // 2 entering second time   
    freq_map[2]++ updates it to 2.   //  so here only value get incriments 
by 1  so key = 2  , value = 2
4. Efficiency:
•Maps use data structures like Red-Black Trees to efficiently perform lookup, 
insertion, and update operations in O(log n) time. 
Key : stores uniqe data  // original data 
Values  :  info about keys  // metadata
